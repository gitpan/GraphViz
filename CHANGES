	- check for "dot" in the Makefile.PL instead of a test, as

	- this is the Flight 63 edition

1.4 Wed Oct  3 07:57:42 BST 2001
	- added new filehandle, scalar reference, and code reference
	  scheme to as_* to allow streaming of data, rather than
	  accumulating potentially very large output in memory (based
	  on patch by Dave Rolsky)

	  PostScript mosaics of large graphs (idea by Nelson Loyola)

1.3 Sun Aug 19 15:43:02 BST 2001
	- labels can now contain quotes

	- new 'rank' node attribute allows nodes to be ranked
          at the same level

	  Slaymaker)

1.2 Fri Aug 10 18:54:21 BST 2001
        - removed the images in the examples directory and added
          a file (make_all.pl) to, errr, make all the images
	- This is the HAL2001 edition

1.1 Tue Jul 24 23:54:42 BST 2001
	- added extra parameter to as_* to allow easy saving of
	  images: $graph->as_png("pretty.png")
	- added new GraphViz::Parse::Yapp module to visualise
	  Parse::Yapp grammars
	- added new GraphViz::Parse::Yacc module to visualise
	  Parse::Yacc grammars

1.00 Thu Jun 14 15:10:28 BST 2001
	- finally released as version 1.00!
	- added a reference to brian d foy's DDJ article on
	  Devel::GraphVizProf
	- put the entire Perl regular expression test suite through
	  GraphViz::Regex and fixed all the bugs
        - no longer sort nodes by default (idea by Stephen Riehm),
          which makes graphs just work better. Not documented, do
          you want it to be?

0.14 Thu May  3 17:57:57 BST 2001
	- added support for InterpLit node in RecDescent grammars
	- added cumulative effect for node attributes (patch by Diego
	  Zamboni)
	- changed the quoting rules again to make it easier to read
	  the dot files (idea by Diego Zamboni)
	- make add_edge() automatically add any nodes specified for
	  the edge that have not been previously added to stop the
	  Graph module complaining (patch by Diego Zamboni)
	- new 'node', 'edge', and 'graph' graph attributes to specify
	  global node, edge, and graph attributes (patch by Diego
	  Zamboni)
	- removed t/regex.t and documented that GraphViz::Regex may
	  not work on various perls
	- added GraphViz::Regex_YAPE module, another way to graph
	  a regular expression

0.13 Mon Mar 19 19:31:18 GMT 2001
	- removed 'use warnings' as suggested by David Adler so we
          no longer require Perl 5.6
	- moved all modules into a new 'lib' directory (and updated
	  examples) so that Devel::GraphVizProf gets installed
	- new 'concentrate' graph attribute to merge edges in
	  cluttered directed graphs
	- new 'random_start' graph attribute, which requests an
	  initial random placement for the graph
	- new 'epsilon' graph attribute, which decides how long the
	  graph solver tries before finding a graph layout, requested
	  by Pierre-Yves Genot
	- an empty cluster now means not clustered
	- added GraphViz::Regex and example regexp.pl which visualises
	  a regular expression
	- now an award-winning module!

0.12
	- fixed bug in redcarpet.pl example
	- new rankdir graph attribute, which controls the direction
	  the nodes are linked together (patch by Mark Fowler)
	- new 'width' and 'height' graph attributes control the size
	  of the bounding box of the drawing in inches, requested by
	  Pierre-Yves Genot

0.11 Tue Mar  6 17:37:20 GMT 2001
	- rearranged module naming: Data::GraphViz ->
	  GraphViz::Data::Dumper, Parse::RecDescent::GraphViz ->
	  GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent, XML::GraphViz -> GraphViz::XML,
	- added GraphViz::Remote so that you do not need to install
	  the graphviz tools to use this module

0.10 Mon Mar  5 17:32:14 GMT 2001
	- now allow simple add_edge({$from => $to}) syntax
	  (idea by DJ Adams and Brian Ingerson)
	- much better documentation (especially on attributes)
	- new module Parse::RecDescent::GraphViz (and example) for
	  graphing Parse::RecDescent grammars (idea by Damian Conway)
	- new module XML::GraphViz (and example) for graphing XML
	- new module Data::GraphViz (and example) for graphing data
	  structures
	- new example ppmgraph.pl by Marcel Grunauer which graphs CPAN
	  tarball dependencies using ActiveState's package list (thanks
	  to Brian Ingerson too ;-)
	- new, better, testsuite
	- better quoting (especially in ports) to allow a greater range	
	  of characters
	- new undocumented (it may change) as_graph method, which
	  returns a graph object with the coordinates of nodes and edges

0.09 Fri Jan 12 15:50:17 GMT 2001
	- moved back to "dot" and "neato" from "dotneato"
	- now allow directed and undirected graphs
	- added GraphViz::No and GraphViz::Small subclasses

	  graphs

0.08 Sun Dec  3 15:15:29 GMT 2000
	- minor patch to cope with DESTROY

0.07 Sun Oct  1 15:19:55 2000

	  including quite a few PNGs

0.06 Thu Aug 24 09:33:21 2000
	- better quoting of nodes and edges (they can now have 
	really wierd names)
	- new examples directory with xref.pl: "graphing subroutine
	cross-reference reports for Perl modules" and example graph to
	see what kind of things it can do

0.05 Wed Aug 18 13:12:25 2000
	- now use dotneato to layout the graphs and can now ouput in a
	variety of file formats

0.04 Wed Aug  9 16:14:35 2000
	- first released version
