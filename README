NAME
       GraphViz - Interface to the GraphViz graphing tool

DESCRIPTION

    This modules provides an interface to layout and generate images of 
    directed graphs in a variety of formats (PostScript, PNG, etc.) using 
    the "dot" and "neato" programs from the GraphViz project 
    (http://www.graphviz.org/). 

Note that you no longer need to install the GraphViz programs if you
use the GraphViz::Remote module.

See the documentation for more information!

Note that Marcel Grunauer has released some modules on CPAN to graph
various other structures. See GraphViz::DBI and GraphViz::ISA for
example.
