NAME
       GraphViz - Interface to the GraphViz graphing tool

DESCRIPTION

    This modules provides an interface to layout and generate images of 
    directed graphs in a variety of formats (PostScript, PNG, etc.) using 
    the "dot" and "neato" programs from the GraphViz project 
    (http://www.graphviz.org/ or
     http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/). 

Note that you need to download and install the GraphViz programs
("dot" and "neato") from either of the URLs above.

See the documentation for more information!

Note that Marcel Grunauer has released some modules on CPAN to graph
various other structures. See GraphViz::DBI and GraphViz::ISA for
example.
