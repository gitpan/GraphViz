NAME
       GraphViz - Interface to the GraphViz graphing tool

DESCRIPTION
       This provides an object-orientated interface to generating
       the ".dot" files needed by the "dotneato" program in the
       GraphViz project (http://www.graphviz.org/). It constructs
       a file which can then be used to draw directed graphs in a
       variety of formats (Postscript, GIF, etc.)
