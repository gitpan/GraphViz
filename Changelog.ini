[V 2.08]
Date=2011-11-01T10:55:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Wind back pre-reqs for various modules to match what was shipped with Perl V 5.8.1.
Many thanx to Brian Cassidy for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72068.
EOT

[V 2.07]
Date=2011-10-30T16:08:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Rewrite Build.PL and Makefile.PL to try loading File::Which rather than assuming it is installed.
This avoids the chicken-and-egg problem whereby these 2 programs need File::Which::which to find 'dot'.
Many thanx to Richard Clamp for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71971.
EOT

[V 2.06]

at the same level
