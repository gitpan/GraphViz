Lots of crazy ideas were given to me after my talk at the German Perl
Workshop, including:

  o Graphing Perl code blocks
  o Graphing Perl 6 RFCs
  o Outputing GraphML
  o Output a graph to ASCII
  o Graphing the symbol table
  o Graphing RDF
  o Graph the current processes running on a system

output to graph and back again
